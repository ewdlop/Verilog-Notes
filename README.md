"One of the primary challenges in deploying multi-layer neural networks onto FPGAs is resource allocation. FPGAs have a finite number of logic gates, and each neuron in our network requires a portion of these resources. It’s akin to assigning seats to an ever-growing audience; there’s only so much space in the concert hall. Engineers must therefore design their networks to be as resource-efficient as possible, which often involves pruning redundant connections and neurons, much like an orchestra might omit unnecessary instruments to achieve a more focused sound."
